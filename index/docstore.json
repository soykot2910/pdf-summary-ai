And like most hackers of our generation, \nwe spent the mid-1990s building PCs out of spare parts, installing \nprerelease versions of Linux from piles of diskettes, and learning to \nadminister Unix machines. We worked as sysadmins, and then at \nthe dawn of the dot-com bubble, became programmers in smaller \ncompanies. After the bubble burst, we started working for surviving \nSilicon Valley companies (such as Apple) and later were hired by a \nstartup (CollabNet) to work full time on designing and writing an \nopen source version control application called Subversion. \nBut something unexpected happened between 2000 and 2005. \nWhile we were creating Subversion, our job responsibilities slowly \nchanged. We weren\u2019t just writing code all day in a vacuum; we \nwere leading an open source project. This meant hanging in a \nchat room all day with a dozen other volunteer programmers and \npaying attention to what they were doing. It meant coordinating \nnew features almost entirely through an email list. Along the way, \nwe discovered that the key to a project\u2019s success wasn\u2019t just writing \ngreat code: the way in which people collaborated toward the end \ngoal mattered just as much. \nIn 2005 we started Google\u2019s Chicago engineering office and \ncontinued our careers as programmers.

Back in mid-2008, we noticed a distinctive trend in the \nsort of requests we were getting: \nCan you guys please give Subversion on Google Code the \nability to hide specific branches? \nCan you guys make it possible to create open source projects \nthat start out hidden to the world, then get revealed when \nthey\u2019re ready? \nHi, I want to rewrite all my code from scratch, can you \nplease wipe all the history? \nCan you spot a common theme to these requests? \nThe key motif here is insecurity. People are afraid of others seeing \nand judging their work in progress. In one sense, it\u2019s just a part of \nhuman nature\u2014nobody likes to be criticized, especially for things \nthat aren\u2019t finished. This attitude tipped us off to a trend within \nsoftware development. Insecurity is actually the symptom of a \nlarger problem. \nThe Genius Myth \nFirst, let\u2019s be clear: we\u2019re not actually sports fans. When our wives \ncheer for baseball or football on TV, we scratch our heads and \nwonder what\u2019s so exciting. Nevertheless, we did live through the \nearly 1990s and witnessed the amazing run of championships by \nthe Chicago Bulls. (That\u2019s a basketball team, by the way.) We were \nboth in Chicago during this period, and the national media was \nsaturated for years with stories about this amazing team. \nWhat did we mostly hear about on TV and in newspapers? Not the \nteam, but Michael Jordan, the superstar. Every player around the \nworld wanted to be MJ. We watched him dance circles around other \nplayers. We watched him in television commercials. We went to see \nsilly movies where he played basketball with cartoon characters. He \nwas a star, and every kid on every court practicing hoops secretly \nwished to grow up and follow his path. \nProgrammers have that same instinct\u2014to find idols and worship \nthem.

As programmers we work best in tight feedback loops: write \na new function, compile. Add a test, compile. Refactor some code, \ncompile. We get the typos and bugs fixed as soon as possible after \ngenerating code. We want the compiler at our side for every little \nstep, playing wingman; some environments can even compile our \ncode as we type.

This was supposedly the only way she could have big uninter\u00ac \nrupted slabs of time to deeply concentrate on writing reams of code. \nWe think that it\u2019s not only unnecessary for most engineers3 to be in \na private office, it\u2019s dangerous. Software today is written by teams, \nnot individuals, and a high-bandwidth, readily available connection \nto the rest of your team is even more valuable than your Internet \nconnection. You can have all the uninterrupted time in the world, \nbut if you\u2019re using it to work on the wrong thing, you\u2019re wasting your \ntime. Walk into the offices of any fast-growing high-tech company that \nstarted in the 21s' century and you\u2019ll find engineers clustered together \nin shared cubicles (a.k.a., \u201cbullpens\u201d) or shared desk areas, but rarely \nwill you find them locked up in offices away from one another. \nOf course, you\u2019ll still need a way to filter out noise and interruptions, \nwhich is why most teams we\u2019ve seen have developed a way to com\u00ac \nmunicate that they\u2019re currently busy and that you should limit inter\u00ac \nruptions. We used to work on a team with a vocal interrupt protocol: \nif you wanted to talk, you would say \u201cbreakpoint Mary\u201d where Mary \nwas the name of the person you wanted to talk to. If Mary was at a \npoint where she could stop, she would swing her chair around and lis\u00ac \nten. If Mary was too busy, she\u2019d just say \u201cack\u201d and you\u2019d go on with \nother things until she finished with her current head state. \nOther teams give out noise-canceling headphones to engineers to \nmake it easier to deal with the noise in the area\u2014in fact, in many \ncompanies the very act of wearing headphones is a common signal \nthat means \u201cdon\u2019t disturb me unless it\u2019s really important.\u201d Still other \nteams have tokens or stuffed animals that team members put on their \nmonitor to signify that they should be interrupted only in case of \nemergency. \nDon\u2019t misunderstand us\u2014we still think engineers need uninterrupted \ntime to focus on writing code, but we think they need a high band\u00ac \nwidth, low-friction connection to their team even more. \n3 We do however acknowledge that serious introverts likely need more peace, \nquiet, and alone time than most people and may benefit from a more quiet envi\u00ac \nronment if not their own office. \nTHE MYTH OF THE GENIUS PROGRAMMER 9", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2457, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dae73ab0-f313-434b-a689-9aba08bd5745": {"__data__": {"id_": "dae73ab0-f313-434b-a689-9aba08bd5745", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\python\\pdf-reader\\data\\Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7300959, "creation_date": "2024-07-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9329b706-9333-4703-88aa-52df58feff77", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\python\\pdf-reader\\data\\Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7300959, "creation_date": "2024-07-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "hash": "710daefd6ab03b749fe2977004330c83c40c3b25bd2a6471c2ba0d51597bb469", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "So what it boils down to is this: working alone is inherently riskier \nthan working with others.

After his first week he really \nstarted digging into the code base. Because he cared about what \nwas going on, he started gently questioning other teammates about \ntheir contributions. He sent simple code reviews by email, politely \nasking about design assumptions or pointing out places where logic \ncould be improved. After a couple of weeks he was summoned to \nhis director\u2019s office. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d Joe asked. \u201cDid I do \nsomething wrong?\u201d The director looked concerned: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a \nlot of complaints about your behavior, Joe. Apparently you\u2019ve been \nreally harsh toward your teammates, criticizing them left and right. \nThey\u2019re upset. You need to tone it down.\u201d Joe was utterly baffled. In \na strong culture based on HRT, Joe\u2019s code reviews should have been \nwelcomed and appreciated by his peers. In this case, however, Joe \nshould have been more sensitive to the team\u2019s widespread insecurity \nand should have used subtler means to introduce code reviews into \nthe culture. \nCriticism is almost never personal in a professional software \nengineering environment\u2014it\u2019s usually just part of the process of \nmaking a better product. The trick is to make sure you (and those \naround you) understand the difference between constructive criticism \nof someone\u2019s creative output and flat-out assaults against someone\u2019s \ncharacter. The latter is useless\u2014it\u2019s petty and nearly impossible to \nact on. The former is always helpful and gives guidance on how \nto improve. And most importantly, it\u2019s imbued with respect: the \nperson giving the constructive criticism genuinely cares about the \nother person and wants her to improve herself or her work. Learn \nto respect your peers and give constructive criticism politely. If you \ntruly respect someone, you\u2019ll be motivated to choose tactful, helpful \nphrasing\u2014a skill acquired with much practice. \nOn the other side of the conversation, you need to learn to accept \ncriticism as well.

On the downside, it\u2019s a lot harder \nto give someone constructive criticism than to simply lambast her \nor ridicule something she did. Of course, we realize it\u2019s incredibly \ndifficult to solicit and then receive constructive criticism from most \npeople\u2014they assume that when you ask them to criticize your \nwork, you\u2019re only looking for compliments and assurance.

Here\u2019s the mission statement: \nGWT\u2019s mission is to radically improve the web experience \nfor users by enabling developers to use existing java tools to \nbuild no-compromise AJAX for any modern browser. \nThere\u2019s a ton of substance packed into that sentence, and we think \nit\u2019s an excellent example of a mission statement: it includes both a \ndirection (improve the web experience ... by enabling developers) \nand a scope limiter (Java tools).

If \nyou\u2019re on a team that has remote workers, this means documenting \nand sharing decisions in writing, usually over email. Online chats, \ninstant messages, and hallway conversations might be where a \nlot of discussion takes place, but there needs to be some way to \nbroadcast relevant discussions like these to everyone to make sure \nthey\u2019re informed and participating (and as a bonus, archived email \nlists provide documentation).

Just the \nsame, many engineers rush right into coding before designing the \nsoftware they intend to write, and this usually ends very badly. \nA design doc is typically owned by one person, authored by two \nor three, and reviewed by a larger set. It serves not only as a high- \nlevel blueprint of your future project, but also as a low-cost way to \ncommunicate to your larger team what you want to do and how \nyou intend to do it.

Once you start coding, however, you should treat your \ndesign doc as a living document and not one carved in stone: you \nand your team should update the document as your project grows \nand changes, not once you\u2019ve shipped, although this is easier said \nthan done.

Set up these lists to \narchive all posts in a searchable index, either publicly available in \nthe case of open source projects or on your company\u2019s intranet if \nyou\u2019re working on a closed source project. Now you have a system \nof record for the history of your project, and it\u2019s easy to refer back \nto it when a newcomer asks about the reasoning behind one or \nmore decisions that you made in the past.

It\u2019s a good tool for teams to use if they\u2019re doing some light \nwork in the evening or on the weekend, or if one team member \nis out of the office for a day or two. One-on-one chat is useful \nand certainly has its place in team communication, but we strongly \nrecommend that teams use some sort of group chat mechanism.14 \nYears before instant messaging became wildly popular, teams would \nhang out in an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel and most of their \ndiscussions would be in a group chat. This could be noisy at times, \nand it was easy enough for team members to break off to have a \nprivate chat if they were discussing something that was not of interest \nto the larger team, but in most cases discussions happened \u201cin front \nof\u201d the rest of the team. This allowed other people to join in on the \nconversation, lurk in the background and follow the discussion, or \neven catch up on discussions they missed earlier. This is convenient \nnot only because of the ease with which ad hoc group discussions \ncan start, but also because it helps to build community even in teams \nthat are geographically dispersed. It\u2019s often surprising how much a \nnewer team member can learn just by watching (or later reading) \nvarious discussions he\u2019s not necessarily participating in. \nWith the advent of instant messaging, many of these conversations \nthat would previously take place in the group chat room moved \nto private chat, which was the default for instant messenger. It\u2019s \nvery tempting to indulge your insecurity and take what might \nbe perceived as a stupid question to a one-on-one discussion \nrather than risk embarrassment in front of the rest of the team. \nUnfortunately, this increases the burden on the team because there\u2019s \nno shared lore created and different team members may ask other \nteam members the same question over and over again. Regardless \n14 Of course, when an engineer needs uninterrupted time and can\u2019t afford the costs \nof context switching, it\u2019s totally acceptable to ignore chat. \n44 CHAPTER 2", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2404, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3f4774f-05c0-4cab-ac57-0ba7b5423124": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3f4774f-05c0-4cab-ac57-0ba7b5423124", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\python\\pdf-reader\\data\\Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7300959, "creation_date": "2024-07-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f89e5262-1a4b-44e2-93a7-f77992e69be2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\python\\pdf-reader\\data\\Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7300959, "creation_date": "2024-07-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "hash": "7ea8a18183e52c1d0c637bc36799ef29dc0d6202a917027b171c0f720ecd7609", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "of the application you use for chat, we strongly recommend that \nyour team have a convenient and accessible mechanism for group \nchat.

We figured \nthat, well, we were late, and everyone was already busy writing \ncode, so we sat down, opened our laptops, fired up our editors, and \nsigned on to the project\u2019s IRC channel to see if folks who couldn\u2019t \nmake it to the hackathon were \u201cvirtually\u201d there, and we found a \nnumber of conversations taking place in the IRC channel.

Whether you review the \ncode before committing it or after committing it, you should make \nsure every line of code that goes into your repository gets a second \npair of eyes on it to check for style, quality, and, of course, careless \nmistakes. Keep code changes small and reviewable\u2014changesets \nthat are thousands of lines long are unreviewable for anything but \nformatting nits. This not only results in a higher-quality code base, \nbut also goes a long way toward instilling a strong sense of group \npride in the quality of your code. \nHave Real Test and Release Processes \nWhether you\u2019re a full-on test-driven development shop or you \njust have some simple regression tests for your product, the more \nautomated tests you have for your product, the more confident \nyou can be when you\u2019re tearing through fixing bugs or adding new \nfeatures. Once your team determines the role that testing will play, it \nshould be part of the coding and review process. Just as importantly, \nyour release process should be lightweight enough that you can do \nfrequent releases (e.g., weekly), but thorough enough that you catch \nbrokenness before it hits your users. \nIt Really Is About the Code After All \nAlthough these habits of culture and communication may seem to \nrepresent a certain amount of bias as they reflect the manner in which \nwe prefer to work, it\u2019s not as subjective as you might think. We\u2019ve \nfound that building a strong, productive team culture and taking \nsome time to pay attention to communication in the team creates a \nteam that will spend more time writing and shipping code and less \ntime arguing about what code to write. \n17 Roy, Blade Runner, 1982.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1973, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78646976-6464-4691-8245-2dcf409b8509": {"__data__": {"id_": "78646976-6464-4691-8245-2dcf409b8509", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\python\\pdf-reader\\data\\Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7300959, "creation_date": "2024-07-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "db7afaef-f392-4fa0-8332-fa70ebd0dce9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\python\\pdf-reader\\data\\Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7300959, "creation_date": "2024-07-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "hash": "85e5a54a1883077b09252a4d81a9af47c36b9cc25ffb9e15395ea19d71793645", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Strong teams don\u2019t arise spontaneously; they\u2019re carefully seeded and \ncultivated by team leads and founders who understand the high cost \nof trying to write software with a dysfunctional team.

Factories started \npopping up everywhere, and they required (usually unskilled) \nworkers to keep the assembly lines moving. Consequently, these \nworkers required supervisors to manage them, and since it was easy \nto replace these workers with other people who were desperate for \na job, the managers had little motivation to treat their employees \nwell or improve conditions for them. Whether humane or not, \nthis method worked well for many years when the employees had \nnothing more to do than perform rote tasks. \nManagers frequently treated employees in the same way that cart \ndrivers would treat their mules: they motivated them by alternately \nleading them forward with a carrot, and, when that didn\u2019t work, \nwhipping them with a stick. This \u201ccarrot and stick\u201d method of \nmanagement survived the transition from the factory to the modern \noffice, where the stereotype of the hard-ass manager-as-mule-driver \nflourished in the middle part of the 20th century when employees \nwould work at the same job for years and years (frequently relying \non their pension as well). \nThis continues today in some industries\u2014even in industries that \nrequire creative thinking and problem solving (like engineering!)\u2014 \ndespite numerous studies suggesting that the anachronistic carrot \nand stick is ineffective2 and harmful to engineers\u2019 productivity. \nWhile the assembly-line worker of years past could be trained in \ndays and replaced at will, an engineer can take months to get up \nto speed on a new team.

The symptoms of this disease include, \nbut are by no means limited to, micromanagement, ignoring low \nperformers, and hiring pushovers. Without prompt treatment, this \ndisease can kill an entire team. The best advice we got when we \nfirst became engineering managers at Google was from Steve Vinter, \nan engineering director. He said, \u201cAbove all, resist the urge to \nmanage.\u201d One of the greatest urges of the newly minted manager is \nto actively \u201cmanage\u201d her employees because that\u2019s what a manager \ndoes, right? This typically has disastrous consequences. \nThe cure for the \u201cmanagement\u201d disease is a liberal application of \nwhat we call \u201cservant leadership,\u201d which is a nice way of saying \nthe most important thing a manager can do is to serve her team, \nmuch like a butler or majordomo tends to the health and well-being \nof a household. As a servant leader, you should strive to create an \natmosphere of humility, respect, and trust (HRT). This may mean \nremoving bureaucratic obstacles that an engineer can\u2019t remove by \nherself, helping a team achieve consensus, or even buying dinner for \nthe team when they\u2019re working late at the office. The servant leader \nfills in the cracks to smooth the way for her team as well as advise \nthem when necessary, but still isn\u2019t afraid of getting her hands dirty. \nThe only managing that a servant leader does is to manage both \nthe technical and social health of the team; as tempting as it may \nbe to focus purely on the technical health of the team, the social \nhealth of the team is just as important (but often infinitely harder \nto manage!). \nEVERY BOAT NEEDS A CAPTAIN 59", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2253, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "126c9568-4724-4519-8da6-7e1ae18021fe": {"__data__": {"id_": "126c9568-4724-4519-8da6-7e1ae18021fe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "60", "file_name": "Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\python\\pdf-reader\\data\\Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7300959, "creation_date": "2024-07-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2d709b64-e3eb-44ed-bf7f-b2a8d184069c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "60", "file_name": "Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\python\\pdf-reader\\data\\Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7300959, "creation_date": "2024-07-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "hash": "5fc112755bc771bf313a2b924c74c7c8f58c2a73a8c976cb38c28f891b66af86", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Antipatterns \nBefore we go over a litany of \u201cdesign patterns\u201d for successful leaders, \nwe\u2019re going to review a collection of the patterns you don\u2019t want to \nfollow if you want to be a successful leader.

You can achieve this by hiring people who aren\u2019t as smart \nor ambitious as you are, or just people who are more insecure than \nyou. While this will cement your position as the team leader and \ndecision maker, it will mean a lot more work for you. Your team \nwon\u2019t be able to make a move without you leading them like dogs \non a leash. If you build a team of pushovers, you probably can\u2019t \ntake a vacation; the moment you leave the room, productivity \ncomes to a screeching halt. But surely this is a small price to pay for \nfeeling secure in your job, right? \nInstead, you should strive to hire people who are smarter than \nyou and can replace you. This can be difficult because these very \nsame people will challenge you on a regular basis (in addition to \nletting you know in no uncertain terms when you screw up). These \nvery same engineers will also consistently impress you and make \ngreat things happen. They\u2019ll be able to direct themselves to a much \ngreater extent, and some will be eager to lead the team as well. You \nshouldn\u2019t see this as an attempt to usurp your power, but rather \nas an opportunity for you to lead an additional team, investigate \nnew opportunities, or even take a vacation without worrying about \nchecking in on the team every day to make sure they\u2019re getting their \nwork done. \nAntipattern: Ignore Low Performers \nEarly in Fitz\u2019s career as a team leader at Google, the time came for \nhim to hand out bonus letters to his team, and he grinned as he \n7 See the section on failure, in Chapter 2. \n60 CHAPTER 3", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2120, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d30d2ce7-8452-456b-a673-63daa41f0916": {"__data__": {"id_": "d30d2ce7-8452-456b-a673-63daa41f0916", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\python\\pdf-reader\\data\\Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7300959, "creation_date": "2024-07-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5df9e1eb-cfe1-42dd-93a2-2b08133237d2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\python\\pdf-reader\\data\\Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7300959, "creation_date": "2024-07-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "hash": "37b47ce03595080dd5566770e6f5405b9dc04ff7e90c887b8469389ca9bbf527", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "told his manager, \u201cI love being an engineering manager!\u201d Without \nmissing a beat, Fitz\u2019s manager, a long-time industry veteran, replied, \n\u201cSometimes you get to be the tooth fairy, other times you have to \nbe the dentist.\u201d \nIt\u2019s never any fun to pull teeth.

It\u2019s rather common for \nleaders to be stronger in the technical side, and since most leaders \nare promoted from a technical job (where the primary goal of their \njob was to solve technical problems), they tend to ignore human \nissues. It\u2019s tempting to focus all your energy on the technical side of \nyour team because, as an individual contributor, the vast majority \nof your time is spent solving technical problems. When you were a \nstudent, your classes were all about learning the technical ins and \nouts of engineering. Now that you\u2019re a leader, however, you ignore \nthe human element of your team at your own peril. \nLet\u2019s start with an example of a leader ignoring the human element \nin his team.

Many leads don\u2019t want to lose the friendships they\u2019ve \ncultivated with their teams, so they will sometimes work extra hard \nto maintain friendships with their team members after becoming a \nteam lead. This can be a recipe for disaster and for a lot of broken \nfriendships.

A common approach we\u2019ve \nseen is that a team needs to hire five engineers, so they sift through \ntheir pile of applications, interview 40 or 50 people, and pick the \nbest five regardless of whether they meet the hiring bar. This is one \nof the fastest ways to build a mediocre team. \nThe cost of finding the right person\u2014whether by paying recruiters, \npaying advertising, or pounding the pavement for references\u2014 \npales in comparison to the cost of dealing with an employee you \nnever should have hired in the first place. This \u201ccost\u201d manifests \nitself in lost team productivity, team stress, time spent managing the \nemployee up or out, and the paperwork and stress involved in firing \nthe employee. That\u2019s assuming, of course, that you try to avoid \nthe monumental cost of just leaving him on the team. If you\u2019re \nmanaging a team where you don\u2019t have a say over hiring and you\u2019re \nunhappy with the hires being made for your team, you need to fight \ntooth and nail for higher-quality engineers.

Another time Ben\u2019s team needed some server resources \nand just couldn\u2019t get them allocated. Fortunately, Ben was in \ncommunication with other teams across the company and managed \nto get the team exactly what they needed that very afternoon. Yet \nanother time one of the engineers on Fitz\u2019s team was having trouble \nwith an arcane bit of Java code, and while Fitz wasn\u2019t a Java expert, \nhe was able to connect the engineer to another engineer who knew \nexactly what the problem was. You don\u2019t have to know all the \nanswers to help remove roadblocks, but it usually helps to know \nthe people who do. In many cases, knowing the right people is more \nvaluable than knowing the right answer. \nAnother way to catalyze your team is to make them feel safe and \nsecure so that they can take greater risks. Risk is a fascinating \nthing\u2014most humans are terrible at evaluating risk, and most \ncompanies try to avoid risk at all costs. As a result of this, the usual \nmodus operandi is to work conservatively and focus on smaller \nsuccesses even when taking a bigger risk might mean exponentially \ngreater success. One thing we often say at Google is that if you \ntry to achieve an impossible goal, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll fail, \nbut if you fail trying to achieve the impossible, you\u2019ll most likely \naccomplish way more than you would have accomplished had you \nmerely attempted something you knew you could complete. A good \nway to build a culture where risk taking is accepted is to let your \nteam know it\u2019s OK to fail. \nSo let\u2019s get that out of the way: it\u2019s OK to fail. In fact, we like to \nthink of failure as a way of learning a lot really quickly, providing \nthat you\u2019re not repeatedly failing at the same thing. In addition, it\u2019s \nimportant to see failure as an opportunity to learn and not to point \nfingers or assign blame. Failing fast is good, because there\u2019s not a lot \nat stake.10 Failing slowly can also teach a valuable lesson, but it is \nmore painful because more is at risk and more can be lost (usually \nengineering time).

If you\u2019re going to get \nyour team moving rapidly in one direction, you need to make sure \nthey all understand and agree on what the direction is.

This not only frees up \nyour time to handle other leadership tasks, but it also drastically \nincreases the efficiency of your team. Teams can (and do) succeed \nwithout clear goals, but they typically waste a great deal of energy as \neach team member pulls the product in a slightly different direction. \nThis frustrates you, slows progress for the team, and forces you to \nuse more and more of your own energy to correct the course. \nEVERY BOAT NEEDS A CAPTAIN 73", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1930, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c203552b-fe53-4917-ac9d-e0ca40e068f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "c203552b-fe53-4917-ac9d-e0ca40e068f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\python\\pdf-reader\\data\\Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7300959, "creation_date": "2024-07-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "54d44c94-ab36-47f3-b6a6-fa47ec87116e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\python\\pdf-reader\\data\\Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7300959, "creation_date": "2024-07-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "hash": "b038c8d0f34e189e69eea46fc71da0fcf3b9bf0602635d94de8ccb853fb8d901", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Be Honest \nThis doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re assuming you are lying to your team, but it \nmerits a mention because you\u2019ll inevitably find yourself in a position \nwhere you can\u2019t tell your team something or, even worse, you have \nto tell them something they don\u2019t want to hear.

In his book Drive,'1 Dan Pink explains \nthat the way to make people the happiest and most productive isn\u2019t \nto motivate them extrinsically (e.g., throw piles of cash at them), \nbut rather to work to increase their intrinsic motivation. Dan claims \nyou can increase intrinsic motivation by giving people three things: \nautonomy, mastery, and purpose.13 \nAn engineer has autonomy when she has the ability to act on her \nown without someone micromanaging her.14 With autonomous \nengineers, you might give them the general direction in which they \nneed to take the product, but leave it up to them to decide how to \nget there. This helps with motivation not only because they have a \ncloser relationship with the product (and likely know better than \nyou how to build it), but also because it gives them a much greater \nsense of ownership of the product. The bigger their stake is in \nthe success of the product, the greater their interest is in seeing it \nsucceed. \nMastery in its basest form simply means you need to give an \nengineer the opportunity to learn new skills and improve existing \nskills. Giving ample opportunities for mastery not only helps to \nmotivate engineers, but also makes them better engineers over time, \nwhich makes for stronger teams.15 An engineer\u2019s skills are like the \nblade of a knife: you may spend tens of thousands of dollars to find \nengineers with the sharpest skills for your team, but if you \u201cuse\u201d \nthat knife for years without sharpening it, you will wind up with \na dull knife that is inefficient, and in some cases useless. Ample \nopportunities for engineers to learn new things and master their \ncraft will keep them sharp, efficient, and effective. \n12 As we mentioned earlier in this chapter, see also Dan\u2019s fantastic TED talk on this \nsubject. \n13 This assumes that the engineers in question are being paid well enough that \nincome is not a source of stress. \n14 Of course, this assumes that you have engineers on your team who don\u2019t need \nmicromanagement. \n15 Of course, it also means they\u2019re more valuable and marketable employees, so it\u2019s \neasier for them to pick up and leave you if they\u2019re not enjoying their work.

Many engineers \nwork on products that have great significance, but they are kept \nat arm\u2019s length from the positive effects their products may have \non their company, their customers, or even the world. Even in \ncases where the product may have a much smaller impact, you \ncan motivate your team by seeking the reason for their efforts and \nmaking this reason clear to them. If you can help them to see this \npurpose in their work, you\u2019ll see a tremendous increase in their \nmotivation and productivity.16 One manager we know keeps a close \neye on the email feedback the company gets for its product (one of \nthe \u201csmaller-impact\u201d products), and whenever he sees a message \nfrom a customer talking about how the company\u2019s product has \nhelped the customer personally or helped the customer\u2019s business, \nhe immediately forwards it to the engineering team. This not only \nmotivates the team, but also frequently inspires them to think about \nways they can make their product even better. \nFinal Thoughts \nRegardless of whether you ever intend to lead a team, we hope this \nchapter has helped you understand what it takes to be a good team \nleader and dispelled some of the myths about what a leader does \nfor a team. Even if you\u2019re resolute in your commitment to never be \na leader, it\u2019s good to be familiar with the concepts laid out in this \nchapter because they can help you understand why the leader of \nyour team does what she does, regardless of whether she\u2019s good at \nher job or terrible at it. Take a moment to look at your team and see \nwhich of these patterns and antipatterns your team leader applies to \nmake your team succeed (or fail), and you\u2019ll have a more concrete \nunderstanding of what makes your team tick. \nBut understanding the team and leader you work with every day \nis only one aspect of working with other people\u2014crossing paths \nwith someone outside your team can be even more challenging, \nespecially if this person is out to sabotage your team. We call these \n\u201cpoisonous people,\u201d and we discuss them in the following chapter. \n16 bttp:llwww.management.wharton.upenn.edu/grant/Grant JAP2008b_TaskSig- \nnificance.pdf \n84 CHAPTER 3", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2333, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "543fa21e-cd61-49ce-b587-d77f13273cd5": {"__data__": {"id_": "543fa21e-cd61-49ce-b587-d77f13273cd5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "85", "file_name": "Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\python\\pdf-reader\\data\\Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7300959, "creation_date": "2024-07-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d6d17655-6885-4b18-9554-2510a6225a8b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "85", "file_name": "Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\python\\pdf-reader\\data\\Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7300959, "creation_date": "2024-07-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "hash": "b27881e9bba47577a595cadaee9115955440df936ad5bc3232a9403919e997c8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CHAPTER 4 \nDealing with Poisonous People \nAs the opening quote of our book suggests, the hardest part of \nsoftware development is people. \nUp until now, we\u2019ve taken an introspective approach.

We spent most of the time talking \nabout what a good culture should include: things like consensus- \nbased development, high-quality code, code reviews, and an \nenvironment where people feel comfortable to try new things and \nto fail fast. \nJust as important is the need to talk about what your culture should \nnot include. If you\u2019re trying to build a highly efficient, fast-moving \nteam, it\u2019s important to focus on what you don\u2019t want. While \nbrilliant engineers can make your team faster and more efficient, \ncertain antibehaviors can make your team slower and less efficient, \nand make your company a less comfortable place to work\u2014and \neventually erode the bonds that hold the team together. \nWhen we first began speaking about the social challenges of software \ndevelopment at conferences, we came up with a presentation titled \n\u201cHow to Deal with Bad Eggs.\u201d The conference chair suggested \nwe rename the talk to \u201cHow Projects Survive Poisonous People,\u201d \nwith the hope that a more tabloidlike title would draw a bigger \naudience. And he was right: we gave the presentation over and \nover at different conferences to standing-room-only crowds. It\u2019s \nnot just the sensational negativity of a word like poisonous that \nattracted people, but the fact that everyone seems to have some \nsort of personal experience in dealing with irritating people. The \ntalks would almost always turn into a group therapy session, with \naudience members swapping war stories and seeking advice. \nBut there\u2019s a danger here. In general, it\u2019s not healthy to spend one\u2019s \ntime stewing in an ocean of negativity\u2014it tends to eat you up and can \ncreate more conflicts in the long run.1 The term poisonous person is \na nasty label and automatically creates a dividing line between \u201cus\u201d \n(the good guys) and \u201cthem\u201d (those nasty jerks). There\u2019s a better \nway to think about the problem. Instead of running your team as \nan elite fraternity with a mission to repel mean people, it\u2019s healthier \nto create a culture that simply refuses to tolerate certain negative \nbehaviors. It\u2019s the behaviors you want to filter out, not particular \nindividuals.

The biggest single influence on the long\u00ac \nterm culture of your team is the team you start with, and if the \nfounding team doesn\u2019t establish a strong enough culture, strains of \nother cultures will overgrow it. If your starter team builds a strong \nsense of acceptable and unacceptable behaviors, these expectations \nwill endure for many years. \nThe two of us have spent a lot of time in the world of open source \nprojects, and our own experiences jibe with this idea pretty strongly. \nThe project we were most involved with\u2014Subversion\u2014was started \nby a very small group of people. They had a lot of humility and \nnaturally trusted and respected one another. After 11-plus years, \nthe project has gone through at least three or four generations of \nparticipants (the founders are mostly gone), and yet the same culture \npersists\u2014everyone is kind, is polite, and expects that same behavior \nfrom everyone else. The culture perpetuates not just because of \nhigh standards, but because cultures tend to be self-selecting. Nice \npeople tend to be attracted to existing nice communities. \nSelf-selection can easily work in the other direction as well. When a \nteam is started by a group of angry jerks, the effort tends to attract \nmore and more individuals of the same sort. Certain projects that \nwe won\u2019t mention here (like the Linux kernel community) are keen \nexamples of this\u2014endless bickering, chest thumping, and sniping. \nThe team may get a lot of work done, but the overall efficiency of \nits operation is doubtful. How much more work would get done \nif so much energy weren\u2019t being spent on personal attacks? How \nmuch potential contribution is lost because polite people are being \ndriven away at the front door? \nDEALING WITH POISONOUS PEOPLE 87", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2201, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96a90c52-c2a4-4d29-b79e-abdfbe1288ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "96a90c52-c2a4-4d29-b79e-abdfbe1288ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "88", "file_name": "Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\python\\pdf-reader\\data\\Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7300959, "creation_date": "2024-07-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d14ea06e-8f07-4106-a736-e0ced49a1319", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "88", "file_name": "Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\python\\pdf-reader\\data\\Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7300959, "creation_date": "2024-07-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "hash": "5fece1a6ee0679dd4d09c40e69527f4c9eb8ac632cf96cfdffcff8475a47be32", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We bring up this topic again because you need to understand \nwhat\u2019s at stake: poisonous people are a direct threat to your high- \nfunctioning team.

On the other hand, he was preventing \nus from making forward progress as a group.

But this person is hung up on this thing called \nSubversion so he has svn instead of cvs. \nsussman: So get an svn client and checkout his sources, \nharry: So I go and download this Subversion thing...can \nyou configure make make install Subversion like you can \ncvs? Of course not. I blame him more than the subversion \npeople. \nsussman: Just because *you* can't ./configure; make; \nmake install doesn't mean there's a big widespread bug. \nPeople do that with the svn tarball every day. \nharry: I didn't say there was a bug. \nsussman: Do you think we would have released the tarball \nif something that fundamental were broken? \nharry: I am just griping about this bozo. I just have to \ninstall expat or libxml. *sigh* \nsussman: Those things are usually pre-installed on most \nsystems. \nDEALING WITH POISONOUS PEOPLE 97", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1571, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fb6a9459-35b5-4579-b92d-45faed262470": {"__data__": {"id_": "fb6a9459-35b5-4579-b92d-45faed262470", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "98", "file_name": "Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\python\\pdf-reader\\data\\Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7300959, "creation_date": "2024-07-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bb5e1aa6-6461-4df1-ae88-89afe5ed9492", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "98", "file_name": "Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\python\\pdf-reader\\data\\Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7300959, "creation_date": "2024-07-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "hash": "5f8066b36ed8a63da5eb3fbe655db06873375eea511c452bdfb264497e6ed174", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "sussman: Is this guy using an apache server?

Eventually \nwe did an analysis of the email discussions and discovered that this \nparticipant had grown into the third most frequent poster over the \ncourse of two months; the first and second most frequent posters \nwere core project contributors, and 70% of their posts were spent \nreplying to Charlie! Clearly our energy and focus were being sucked \naway, despite no ill will from Charlie himself. Our final solution \nwas to privately email him (and politely) ask him to stop posting \nso often. It was a difficult conversation to have, mainly because he \nwas unable to see the amount of disruption he was causing. After \na few more weeks without a significant behavioral change, one of \nus actually had a long (and even more difficult) discussion with \nhim over the phone where we asked him to stop posting altogether. \nHe ultimately withdrew as requested, a bit sad and confused, but \nrespectful of the team\u2019s wishes.

We talked a lot in Chapters 3 \nand 4 about the importance of taking risks and failing fast. In the \npresence of an enlightened manager, failing is a great way to learn \nquickly, discover the limits of what you can and can\u2019t do, and grow \nthose limits over time. Our friend Steve Hayman, who travels a lot \nfor work, has often said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t miss at least one flight a year, \nyou\u2019re getting to the airport too early.\u201d This is a great metaphor for \nsoftware development: if you don\u2019t fail at least once a year, you\u2019re \nnot taking enough risks. And like the pursuit of extra responsibility, \ntaking risks is a way to show you\u2019re capable of bigger things. \nIf you don\u2019t take risks in your work, you\u2019ll have fewer failures, but \nyou\u2019ll have fewer big successes as well. A good manager wants a \nteam that\u2019s willing to push the envelope to see what they can and \ncan\u2019t do (and to learn a lot in the process), and she\u2019ll provide a soft \nlanding for when you fail. When you fail, take responsibility, don\u2019t \nseek to assign blame, and document what happened and what you \ncan do to avoid that same failure again. Lather, rinse, repeat. \nAct like an adult. Another recommendation in a long line of \nsuggestions that seem glaringly obvious: you are responsible for \nteaching people how to act and how to treat you. Bad managers \nwill frequently train their teams to act like children by squashing \nany initiative, responsibility, or rule breaking. If you\u2019ve had one of \nthese managers, you often come to expect this sort of treatment \nfrom all managers. \nQuestion things that you\u2019re unsure about. If your manager makes \na decision that you disagree with, don\u2019t be afraid to argue with her \nor question the premise upon which she made the decision. While \nthis isn\u2019t a license to be an obstacle, being a \u201cyes-man\u201d isn\u2019t helpful \nto someone in a leadership position if you\u2019ve got information or \nexperience that she lacks. \nYour manager is not clairvoyant: only rarely will you find a person \nin an organization who overcommunicates, so don\u2019t hesitate to \nupdate your team\u2019s leader on what you\u2019re doing before she asks you \nwhat\u2019s going on. Drop her a quick note when you hit an obstacle, \nscore a victory, need something, or expect something. Not only is \nthis a great way to make sure your manager knows what you\u2019re \nup to, but we\u2019ve seen crafty engineers take this technique to the \nextreme as a way to deal with micromanagement: if your manager \nkeeps checking in on you, proactively sending her an email at the \n106 CHAPTER 5", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2556, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aeef3ce2-36a6-4c18-b076-31c957a66848": {"__data__": {"id_": "aeef3ce2-36a6-4c18-b076-31c957a66848", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\python\\pdf-reader\\data\\Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7300959, "creation_date": "2024-07-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b8259d56-847f-4b99-be06-4389948648fd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\python\\pdf-reader\\data\\Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7300959, "creation_date": "2024-07-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "hash": "ee4d6c3e571245b00331f7cce6d38cbf060533f72f696d018999a23eef665f38", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "same frequency with which she checks in on you is a surefire way \nto get her to back off. \nThese techniques work well when you\u2019re in the ideal organization, \nbut what about when your organization is anything but ideal? \nThe Reality: When Your Environment \nIs an Obstacle to Your Success \nHappy families are all alike; every unhappy family is \nunhappy in its own way.\u2014Leo Tolstoy, Anna Karenina* 1 \nThere are innumerable ways in which the environment in your \ncompany can work to prevent you from succeeding, but they can \nusually be divided into two major categories: bad people and bad \norganizations. \nYour Life Under a Bad Manager \nIt\u2019s hard to know where to start when describing the traits of a bad \nmanager\u2014entire movies and TV shows have been created solely \nto lampoon the bad managers of the world.

If you focus on \nthe way things should be in your organization, you\u2019ll find nothing \nbut frustration and disappointment. Instead, acknowledge the way \nthings are, and focus on navigating your organization\u2019s structure to \nfind the mechanisms you can use to get things done and to carve \nout a happy place for yourself in your company. Whether you\u2019re in \na good organization or a bad one, there are a number of strategies \nthat we\u2019ve found to be quite effective at getting things done. \n\"It's Easier to Ask for Forgiveness Than Permission\"6 \nFirst and foremost, know what you can get away with in your \norganization\u2014while asking for permission does give you an \nopportunity to push responsibility onto someone else, it also creates \nan opportunity for someone to tell you \u201cno.\u201d It\u2019s important to know \nwhat you can get away with in your organization without explicitly \ngetting approval from one of your superiors, but wherever possible, \nwe advise you to do what you think is right for the company. \nEven if you\u2019re prepared to beg for forgiveness, choose your battles \nwisely\u2014every time you have to plead your case for something or \ngo up against someone else in your company, you\u2019re spending your \npolitical capital. If you spend all your capital winning a bunch of \nbattles that just don\u2019t matter, you\u2019re going to find that you have \nnothing left in your account when it comes to the important things. \nBe strategic and fight for things either that matter or that you\u2019re \npretty sure you have some chance of winning. Blowing all your \ncapital on a battle you know you can\u2019t win is pointless, stressful, \nand career limiting for no good reason. \nIf you do decide to go the \u201cbeg for forgiveness\u201d route, it\u2019s useful \nto have colleagues and friends in your company that you can use \nas a sounding board for your ideas\u2014especially your riskier ideas. \n6 Widely attributed to Admiral Grace Murray Hopper, co-inventor of COBOL and \nan incredibly witty computer scientist. \nTHE ART OF ORGANIZATIONAL MANIPULATION 113", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2265, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "82ecb79f-4a39-472c-a83c-fcecffdc88d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "82ecb79f-4a39-472c-a83c-fcecffdc88d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "114", "file_name": "Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\python\\pdf-reader\\data\\Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7300959, "creation_date": "2024-07-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b9e4d66e-81ae-4303-9047-6ebe29d34895", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "114", "file_name": "Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\python\\pdf-reader\\data\\Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7300959, "creation_date": "2024-07-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "hash": "c16c2bfcb8b59d809cb389a00555e061463ed04dc1d13c8770c6fd7159cc801a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "These people should have a good sense of what you can and can t \nget away with in the company as well as which ideas just won\u2019t fly. \nWhen someone in marketing suggested that Fitz raise awareness \nof his Data Liberation team among the executives at Google, Fitz \nbounced an idea off his sounding-board colleagues: give Data \nLiberation-branded bolt cutters and locked boxes of swag (with \nthe keys locked inside, of course) to the execs.

I tell them only \nhalf-jokingly that it\u2019s very simple: I do the Right Thing \nfor Google and the world, and then I sit back and wait to \nget fired. If I don\u2019t get fired. I\u2019ve done the Right Thing for \neveryone. If I do get fired, this is the wrong employer to \nwork for in the first place. So, either way, I win. That is my \ncareer strategy. \nI discovered where I got this rebel streak from only very \nrecently. I realized I inherited it from my dad, which was \nvery strange to me because when I was growing up, I \nperceived my dad as an establishment figure, part of the \nvery establishment I was rebelling against, so it was a severe \ncognitive dissonance for me to think of my dad as a rebel. \nBut rebel he was. \n14 http://www.mengstupiditis.com/2011/06/do-right-thing-wait-to-get-fired.html \n126 CHAPTERS", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2114, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "49891c63-8683-4c5a-9b26-f2a8e4017b26": {"__data__": {"id_": "49891c63-8683-4c5a-9b26-f2a8e4017b26", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "127", "file_name": "Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\python\\pdf-reader\\data\\Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7300959, "creation_date": "2024-07-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4f5abc36-dbc6-4cd7-9e0b-4df0bda82340", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "127", "file_name": "Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\python\\pdf-reader\\data\\Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7300959, "creation_date": "2024-07-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "hash": "af9acb37c365d348bfee0b912fdbefa3c22769429ca584fcfd6b325501acca06", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "My dad started his career as a child laborer (yes, one of those \nmillions of faceless children in developing countries you read \nabout occasionally in National Geographic), but by mid\u00ac \ncareer, he rose up the ranks to become one of the most senior \nmilitary officers in all of Singapore.

Why do we shudder at the \nthought of the marketing person? \nBecause, as programmers, the marketer represents the antithesis \nof engineering culture. We\u2019re obsessed with truth. Either the code \ncompiles or it doesn\u2019t; the software has a feature or it doesn\u2019t; it \nsolves a problem or it doesn\u2019t. We don\u2019t \u201cspin\u201d our descriptions \nof the world; we state the facts and then work to change them. We \nlook at the marketing guy and all we see are lies, and we don\u2019t like \nbeing lied to. We want order, predictability, and accurate statements \nwhen it comes to making decisions. \nBecause we perceive marketing as something that distorts the \ntruth, it violates the engineer\u2019s instinctive desire for meritocracy. \nWe believe the best product should always win. And by \u201cbest\u201d we \nmean the product that objectively is of the highest quality and most \neffective, not the one with the slickest TV advertisements. Over and \nover we\u2019re disappointed when we see superior technologies lose out: \nmany believe that Betamax was superior to VHS, that Laserdisc \nwas better than DVD, or that Lisp is still the best programming \nlanguage (we just need to get the word out!).

It\u2019s conducive to tinkering: just start \nhacking on your site and figure out different PHP tricks from your \npeers. \nAnother example can be found in text editors. Should programmers \nuse Emacs or vi? Does it matter? Not really, but why would a \nperson choose one over the other? Here\u2019s a true anecdote: when \nBen first started learning Unix (during an internship in 1990) he \nwas looking for a text editor to launch.

Because the initial behavior of Emacs was identical to \nhis previous experiences, Ben decided to become an Emacs user \nwithin his first minute. It\u2019s a silly reason to choose one product \nover another, but this sort of thing happens all the time!

The \nfirst time your software runs, don\u2019t present the user with a giant \nform to fill out or a giant panel of mandatory preferences to set. \nForcing the user to create some sort of new account is pretty off- \nputting as well; it implies long-term commitment before the user \nhas even done anything.

Before iPods came along, there \nwere a handful of awkward gizmos that tried to manage music \nright on the portable device. Apple\u2019s genius was to realize that MP3 \nmanagement was too difficult a problem to solve on a tiny screen, \nso it moved the solution to a big computer. iTunes was the answer. \nYou use your computer (with big screen, keyboard, and mouse) \nto manage your music collection, and then use the iPod just for \nplayback. The iPod can then be simple and elegant, and organizing \nyour music is no longer frustrating. \nGoogle is another well-known example. Google\u2019s search interface \n(and barrier to entry) is almost nonexistent: it\u2019s just a magic box \nto type in. Yet behind that box, there are thousands of machines \nacross the planet responding in parallel to every keystroke you type, \ngiving you auto-completion suggestions. By the time you hit Enter \nthe search results have already been collated and rendered in the \nbackground, ready to instantly display on your screen.

While \nmasking complexity is laudable, it is not a goal to seal the \nsoftware so tight that it ends up handcuffing all your users. Hiding \ncomplexity almost always involves creating clever abstractions, \nand as a programmer you need to assume that the abstractions will \neventually \u201cleak.\u201d When a web browser prints a 404 error, that\u2019s a \nleaked abstraction; the illusion is cracked. Don\u2019t panic, though\u2014it\u2019s \nbetter to assume that abstractions are leaky and simply embrace \nthem by providing deliberate ways to lift the curtain. A great way \nto do this is to provide APIs to other programmers. Or for really \nadvanced users, create an \u201cexpert mode\u201d that provides more \noptions and choices for those who want to bypass the abstractions. \nNot only is it important to keep the interface flexible and able to be \ncircumvented; the user\u2019s data needs to be accessible as well. Fitz has \nput a great deal of passion into making sure Google products offer \n\u201cdata liberation\u201d\u2014that it\u2019s trivial for a user to export his data from \nan application and walk away. Software shouldn\u2019t lock users in, no \nmatter how elegant the interface is. By allowing users to open the \nhood and do whatever they want with their data, it forces you to \ncompete honestly: people use your software because they want to, \nnot because they\u2019re trapped. It\u2019s about engendering trust, which (as \nwe\u2019ll mention) is your most sacred resource. \nManaging Your Relationship with Users \nOK, so your software is appealing on first sight. It\u2019s easy to get \nstarted. And once people begin, it\u2019s really pleasant and usable. \nWhat happens months down the line? How do you interact with \npeople who use your software every day, for years at a time? \nBelieve it or not, many users want to have a relationship with your \ncompany or team. Happy users want to know what\u2019s going on with \nyour software\u2019s evolution; angry users want a place to complain. \nOne of the biggest mistakes programmers make is to toss software \nover a wall and then stop listening to feedback. \n1 See Arthur C.

It applies to the way people \nlead teams: skilled leaders serve their teams and not the other way \naround. HRT also applies to the way you interoperate with and \nsurvive temporary collaborators outside your team, whether they \nare nice folks, jerks, or a dysfunctional bureaucracy. And finally, \nthese principles apply directly to the way you interact with the most \nimportant group of all\u2014the users of your software. \n157", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1445, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1cd8ea84-84b6-42f3-8873-9f4c25cee64d": {"__data__": {"id_": "1cd8ea84-84b6-42f3-8873-9f4c25cee64d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "158", "file_name": "Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\python\\pdf-reader\\data\\Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7300959, "creation_date": "2024-07-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "094f884d-33a2-4831-b42a-0db67576717c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "158", "file_name": "Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\python\\pdf-reader\\data\\Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7300959, "creation_date": "2024-07-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "hash": "6525ce509d98c4ca38664bcc3854656c141e1d1a59d032b2d0afd9c060841089", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "If you keep HRT at the forefront of the way you work, you\u2019ll have \ngreater impact with considerably less effort. We think it\u2019s the best \nway to end up spending the most amount of time doing what you \nlove (shipping great software) and the least amount of time dealing \nwith social conflicts, bureaucracy, and other human drama. \nA Final Thought \nIt\u2019s time to let the cat out of the bag. If you haven\u2019t figured it out \nalready, most of the advice in our book isn\u2019t necessarily specific to \nsoftware development. \nOur stories are essentially about the art of maintaining a healthy, \nfunctional community\u2014any community. You could take our \nanecdotes, remove the parts specific to software development, and \nsubstitute any other sort of activity. We could be talking about a \nneighborhood club, a church group, a fraternity, or a construction \nteam; the same social problems exist and the same solutions are \napplicable. Humans are tricky to deal with no matter what the \ncontext, and software development has the same community-health \nissues as any other group endeavor. \nSo, while you\u2019re out there busily incorporating HRT into your daily \nlife as a programmer, keep in mind that it applies to the rest of your \nlife as well. \nWho knows? It\u2019s possible that our real calling may be in writing \nchurch sermons. But for now we\u2019ll stick to writing software and \ngetting the most out of collaboration. And now you have the power \nto do that, too. \n158 EPILOGUE", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1454, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "552dcbf1-8d83-431d-adc8-a00c612d45af": {"__data__": {"id_": "552dcbf1-8d83-431d-adc8-a00c612d45af", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "159", "file_name": "Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\python\\pdf-reader\\data\\Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7300959, "creation_date": "2024-07-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8287424-5b71-4cf4-8d49-6ec957ac1d26", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "159", "file_name": "Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_path": "d:\\python\\pdf-reader\\data\\Team_Geek_Book.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7300959, "creation_date": "2024-07-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-07-02"}, "hash": "6a1a3f7a3f9e25f8c7ee602cfbc27187b7f19e78aac78fd5770b2a1c9ee41b9a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "APPENDIX A \nFurther Reading \nWe created this book based on our experiences writing software \nwith numerous teams and people, but we\u2019ve also read many books \nand articles that have helped us formulate the thoughts that we laid \nout on these pages.
