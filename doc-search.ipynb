People are hard. ” \\n— Bill Coughran, former senior vice \\npresident of engineering at Google \\nLife is full of unexpected twists, and the two of us never imagined \\nwe’d someday write a book about software engineering. \\nLike most computer geeks, we discovered that our hobby and \\npassion—playing with computers—was a great way to make a living \\nafter graduating college. And like most hackers of our generation, \\nwe spent the mid-1990s building PCs out of spare parts, installing \\nprerelease versions of Linux from piles of diskettes, and learning to \\nadminister Unix machines. We worked as sysadmins, and then at \\nthe dawn of the dot-com bubble, became programmers in smaller \\ncompanies. After the bubble burst, we started working for surviving \\nSilicon Valley companies (such as Apple) and later were hired by a \\nstartup (CollabNet) to work full time on designing and writing an \\nopen source version control application called Subversion. \\nBut something unexpected happened between 2000 and 2005. \\nWhile we were creating Subversion, our job responsibilities slowly \\nchanged. We weren’t just writing code all day in a vacuum; we \\nwere leading an open source project. This meant hanging in a \\nchat room all day with a dozen other volunteer programmers and \\npaying attention to what they were doing. It meant coordinating \\nnew features almost entirely through an email list. Along the way, \\nwe discovered that the key to a project’s success wasn’t just writing \\ngreat code: the way in which people collaborated toward the end \\ngoal mattered just as much. \\nIn 2005 we started Google’s Chicago engineering office and \\ncontinued our careers as programmers.

We were \\nboth in Chicago during this period, and the national media was \\nsaturated for years with stories about this amazing team. \\nWhat did we mostly hear about on TV and in newspapers? Not the \\nteam, but Michael Jordan, the superstar. Every player around the \\nworld wanted to be MJ. We watched him dance circles around other \\nplayers. We watched him in television commercials. We went to see \\nsilly movies where he played basketball with cartoon characters. He \\nwas a star, and every kid on every court practicing hoops secretly \\nwished to grow up and follow his path. \\nProgrammers have that same instinct—to find idols and worship \\nthem.

Think about how different the experience would \\nbe if you had a couple of peers to look over your shoulder and tell \\nyou—instantly—how you goofed and how to get past the problem. \\nThis is exactly why teams sit together (or do pair programming) in \\nsoftware engineering companies: you often find yourself needing a \\nsecond pair of eyes. \\nHere’s another analogy. Think about how you work with your \\ncompiler. When you sit down to write a large piece of software, do \\nyou spend days or weeks writing code, then when you think it’s all \\ndone and completely perfect, press the “compile” button for the \\nvery first time? Of course you don’t. Can you imagine what sort \\nof disaster would result, trying to compile 50,000 virgin lines of \\ncode? As programmers we work best in tight feedback loops: write \\na new function, compile. Add a test, compile. Refactor some code, \\ncompile. We get the typos and bugs fixed as soon as possible after \\ngenerating code. We want the compiler at our side for every little \\nstep, playing wingman; some environments can even compile our \\ncode as we type. This is how we keep code quality high and make \\nsure our software is evolving correctly bit by bit. \\nThe same sort of rapid feedback loop is needed not just at the \\ncode level, but at the whole-project level too.

It’s much \\neasier to hang out with a predictable compiler, isn’t it? Why bother \\nwith the social stuff at all? \\nHere’s a quote from a famous lecture by Richard Hamming:5 \\nBy taking the trouble to tell jokes to the secretaries and being \\na little friendly, I got superb secretarial help. For instance, \\none time for some idiot reason all the reproducing services at \\nMurray Hill were tied up. Don’t ask me how, but they were. \\nI wanted something done. My secretary called up somebody \\nat Holmdel, hopped [into] the company car, made the hour- \\nlong trip down and got it reproduced, and then came back. It \\nwas a payoff for the times I had made an effort to cheer her \\nup, tell her jokes and be friendly; it was that little extra work \\nthat later paid off for me.

Even if you know you’re the wisest person in the discussion, \\ndon’t wave it in people’s faces. For example, do you always feel like \\nyou need to have the first or last word on every subject?

After his first week he really \\nstarted digging into the code base. Because he cared about what \\nwas going on, he started gently questioning other teammates about \\ntheir contributions. He sent simple code reviews by email, politely \\nasking about design assumptions or pointing out places where logic \\ncould be improved. After a couple of weeks he was summoned to \\nhis director’s office. “What’s the problem?” Joe asked. “Did I do \\nsomething wrong?” The director looked concerned: “We’ve had a \\nlot of complaints about your behavior, Joe. Apparently you’ve been \\nreally harsh toward your teammates, criticizing them left and right. \\nThey’re upset. You need to tone it down.” Joe was utterly baffled. In \\na strong culture based on HRT, Joe’s code reviews should have been \\nwelcomed and appreciated by his peers. In this case, however, Joe \\nshould have been more sensitive to the team’s widespread insecurity \\nand should have used subtler means to introduce code reviews into \\nthe culture. \\nCriticism is almost never personal in a professional software \\nengineering environment—it’s usually just part of the process of \\nmaking a better product. The trick is to make sure you (and those \\naround you) understand the difference between constructive criticism \\nof someone’s creative output and flat-out assaults against someone’s \\ncharacter. The latter is useless—it’s petty and nearly impossible to \\nact on. The former is always helpful and gives guidance on how \\nto improve. And most importantly, it’s imbued with respect: the \\nperson giving the constructive criticism genuinely cares about the \\nother person and wants her to improve herself or her work. Learn \\nto respect your peers and give constructive criticism politely. If you \\ntruly respect someone, you’ll be motivated to choose tactful, helpful \\nphrasing—a skill acquired with much practice. \\nOn the other side of the conversation, you need to learn to accept \\ncriticism as well. This means not just being humble about your \\nskills, but trusting that the other person has your best interests (and \\nthose of your project!) at heart and doesn’t actually think you’re \\n16 CHAPTER 1 ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

It’s a good tool for teams to use if they’re doing some light \\nwork in the evening or on the weekend, or if one team member \\nis out of the office for a day or two. One-on-one chat is useful \\nand certainly has its place in team communication, but we strongly \\nrecommend that teams use some sort of group chat mechanism.14 \\nYears before instant messaging became wildly popular, teams would \\nhang out in an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel and most of their \\ndiscussions would be in a group chat. This could be noisy at times, \\nand it was easy enough for team members to break off to have a \\nprivate chat if they were discussing something that was not of interest \\nto the larger team, but in most cases discussions happened “in front \\nof” the rest of the team. This allowed other people to join in on the \\nconversation, lurk in the background and follow the discussion, or \\neven catch up on discussions they missed earlier. This is convenient \\nnot only because of the ease with which ad hoc group discussions \\ncan start, but also because it helps to build community even in teams \\nthat are geographically dispersed. It’s often surprising how much a \\nnewer team member can learn just by watching (or later reading) \\nvarious discussions he’s not necessarily participating in. \\nWith the advent of instant messaging, many of these conversations \\nthat would previously take place in the group chat room moved \\nto private chat, which was the default for instant messenger. It’s \\nvery tempting to indulge your insecurity and take what might \\nbe perceived as a stupid question to a one-on-one discussion \\nrather than risk embarrassment in front of the rest of the team. \\nUnfortunately, this increases the burden on the team because there’s \\nno shared lore created and different team members may ask other \\nteam members the same question over and over again.

Factories started \\npopping up everywhere, and they required (usually unskilled) \\nworkers to keep the assembly lines moving. Consequently, these \\nworkers required supervisors to manage them, and since it was easy \\nto replace these workers with other people who were desperate for \\na job, the managers had little motivation to treat their employees \\nwell or improve conditions for them. Whether humane or not, \\nthis method worked well for many years when the employees had \\nnothing more to do than perform rote tasks. \\nManagers frequently treated employees in the same way that cart \\ndrivers would treat their mules: they motivated them by alternately \\nleading them forward with a carrot, and, when that didn’t work, \\nwhipping them with a stick. This “carrot and stick” method of \\nmanagement survived the transition from the factory to the modern \\noffice, where the stereotype of the hard-ass manager-as-mule-driver \\nflourished in the middle part of the 20th century when employees \\nwould work at the same job for years and years (frequently relying \\non their pension as well). \\nThis continues today in some industries—even in industries that \\nrequire creative thinking and problem solving (like engineering!)— \\ndespite numerous studies suggesting that the anachronistic carrot \\nand stick is ineffective2 and harmful to engineers’ productivity. \\nWhile the assembly-line worker of years past could be trained in \\ndays and replaced at will, an engineer can take months to get up \\nto speed on a new team. Unlike the mechanical efficiency of the \\nassembly-line worker, an engineer needs nurturing, time, and space \\nto think and create. \\n\"Leader\" Is the New \"Manager\" \\nMost people still use the title “manager” in the engineering world \\ndespite the fact that it’s an anachronism.

A common approach we’ve \\nseen is that a team needs to hire five engineers, so they sift through \\ntheir pile of applications, interview 40 or 50 people, and pick the \\nbest five regardless of whether they meet the hiring bar. This is one \\nof the fastest ways to build a mediocre team. \\nThe cost of finding the right person—whether by paying recruiters, \\npaying advertising, or pounding the pavement for references— \\npales in comparison to the cost of dealing with an employee you \\nnever should have hired in the first place. This “cost” manifests \\nitself in lost team productivity, team stress, time spent managing the \\nemployee up or out, and the paperwork and stress involved in firing \\nthe employee. That’s assuming, of course, that you try to avoid \\nthe monumental cost of just leaving him on the team. If you’re \\nmanaging a team where you don’t have a say over hiring and you’re \\nunhappy with the hires being made for your team, you need to fight \\ntooth and nail for higher-quality engineers. If you still keep getting \\nhanded substandard engineers, maybe it’s time to look for another \\njob. Without the raw materials for a great team, you’re doomed. \\nAntipattern: Treat Your Team Like Children \\nThe best way to show your team you don’t trust them is to treat \\nthem like kids—people tend to act the way you treat them, so \\nif you treat them like children or prisoners, don’t be surprised \\nwhen that’s how they behave. You can manifest this behavior by \\n64 CHAPTER 3 ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

In his book Drive,'1 Dan Pink explains \\nthat the way to make people the happiest and most productive isn’t \\nto motivate them extrinsically (e.g., throw piles of cash at them), \\nbut rather to work to increase their intrinsic motivation. Dan claims \\nyou can increase intrinsic motivation by giving people three things: \\nautonomy, mastery, and purpose.13 \\nAn engineer has autonomy when she has the ability to act on her \\nown without someone micromanaging her.14 With autonomous \\nengineers, you might give them the general direction in which they \\nneed to take the product, but leave it up to them to decide how to \\nget there. This helps with motivation not only because they have a \\ncloser relationship with the product (and likely know better than \\nyou how to build it), but also because it gives them a much greater \\nsense of ownership of the product. The bigger their stake is in \\nthe success of the product, the greater their interest is in seeing it \\nsucceed. \\nMastery in its basest form simply means you need to give an \\nengineer the opportunity to learn new skills and improve existing \\nskills. Giving ample opportunities for mastery not only helps to \\nmotivate engineers, but also makes them better engineers over time, \\nwhich makes for stronger teams.15 An engineer’s skills are like the \\nblade of a knife: you may spend tens of thousands of dollars to find \\nengineers with the sharpest skills for your team, but if you “use” \\nthat knife for years without sharpening it, you will wind up with \\na dull knife that is inefficient, and in some cases useless.

They had a lot of humility and \\nnaturally trusted and respected one another. After 11-plus years, \\nthe project has gone through at least three or four generations of \\nparticipants (the founders are mostly gone), and yet the same culture \\npersists—everyone is kind, is polite, and expects that same behavior \\nfrom everyone else. The culture perpetuates not just because of \\nhigh standards, but because cultures tend to be self-selecting. Nice \\npeople tend to be attracted to existing nice communities. \\nSelf-selection can easily work in the other direction as well. When a \\nteam is started by a group of angry jerks, the effort tends to attract \\nmore and more individuals of the same sort. Certain projects that \\nwe won’t mention here (like the Linux kernel community) are keen \\nexamples of this—endless bickering, chest thumping, and sniping. \\nThe team may get a lot of work done, but the overall efficiency of \\nits operation is doubtful.

We talked a lot in Chapters 3 \\nand 4 about the importance of taking risks and failing fast. In the \\npresence of an enlightened manager, failing is a great way to learn \\nquickly, discover the limits of what you can and can’t do, and grow \\nthose limits over time. Our friend Steve Hayman, who travels a lot \\nfor work, has often said, “If you don’t miss at least one flight a year, \\nyou’re getting to the airport too early.” This is a great metaphor for \\nsoftware development: if you don’t fail at least once a year, you’re \\nnot taking enough risks. And like the pursuit of extra responsibility, \\ntaking risks is a way to show you’re capable of bigger things. \\nIf you don’t take risks in your work, you’ll have fewer failures, but \\nyou’ll have fewer big successes as well. A good manager wants a \\nteam that’s willing to push the envelope to see what they can and \\ncan’t do (and to learn a lot in the process), and she’ll provide a soft \\nlanding for when you fail. When you fail, take responsibility, don’t \\nseek to assign blame, and document what happened and what you \\ncan do to avoid that same failure again. Lather, rinse, repeat. \\nAct like an adult. Another recommendation in a long line of \\nsuggestions that seem glaringly obvious: you are responsible for \\nteaching people how to act and how to treat you. Bad managers \\nwill frequently train their teams to act like children by squashing \\nany initiative, responsibility, or rule breaking. If you’ve had one of \\nthese managers, you often come to expect this sort of treatment \\nfrom all managers. \\nQuestion things that you’re unsure about. If your manager makes \\na decision that you disagree with, don’t be afraid to argue with her \\nor question the premise upon which she made the decision. While \\nthis isn’t a license to be an obstacle, being a “yes-man” isn’t helpful \\nto someone in a leadership position if you’ve got information or \\nexperience that she lacks. \\nYour manager is not clairvoyant: only rarely will you find a person \\nin an organization who overcommunicates, so don’t hesitate to \\nupdate your team’s leader on what you’re doing before she asks you \\nwhat’s going on. Drop her a quick note when you hit an obstacle, \\nscore a victory, need something, or expect something. Not only is \\nthis a great way to make sure your manager knows what you’re \\nup to, but we’ve seen crafty engineers take this technique to the \\nextreme as a way to deal with micromanagement: if your manager \\nkeeps checking in on you, proactively sending her an email at the \\n106 CHAPTER 5 ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Things didn’t go well. Despite the \\nprior approval, Ben’s manager began to get annoyed and impatient \\nafter a few months—why was the team getting “nothing done”? Ben’s \\nteam was actually quite productive and he tried to show the enor¬ \\nmous amount of debt that had been paid back. But it turns out there’s \\njust no way this sort of work can impress someone; at an emotional \\nlevel it’s just fundamentally boring. \\nAfter this bad experience, Ben began to categorize all work as either \\n“offensive” or “defensive.” Offensive work is typically effort toward \\nnew user-visible features—shiny things that are easy to show outsid¬ \\ners and get them excited about, or things that noticeably advance the \\nsexiness of a product (e.g., improved UI, speed, or interoperability). \\nDefensive work is effort aimed at the long-term health of a product \\n(e.g., code refactoring, feature rewrites, schema changes, data migra¬ \\ntion, or improved emergency monitoring).

On average, the unlucky people \\ntook about two minutes to count the photographs, whereas \\nthe lucky people took just seconds. Why? Because the \\nsecond page of the newspaper contained the message: “Stop \\ncounting. There are 43 photographs in this newspaper. ” This \\nmessage took up half of the page and was written in type \\nthat was more than 2in high. It was staring everyone straight \\nin the face, but the unlucky people tended to miss it and the \\nlucky people tended to spot it. \\nHe then goes on to note that lucky people “are skilled at creating and \\nnoticing chance opportunities.” We think the same tenet applies to \\ncreating opportunities in companies: if you perform your job to the \\nletter of the law and focus only on getting your own work done to \\nthe exclusion of all else, there will be few chance opportunities for \\nyou. If you help others get their jobs done when given the chance, \\neven when it’s not part of your job, there’s no guarantee (nor should \\nthere be a “tit for tat” expectation) that they’ll return the favor, but \\nmany people will gladly repay the favor in the future if given the \\nchance. \\nEvery company has this sort of gray-market favor economy that \\nlives outside the org chart.

We don’t “spin” our descriptions \\nof the world; we state the facts and then work to change them. We \\nlook at the marketing guy and all we see are lies, and we don’t like \\nbeing lied to. We want order, predictability, and accurate statements \\nwhen it comes to making decisions. \\nBecause we perceive marketing as something that distorts the \\ntruth, it violates the engineer’s instinctive desire for meritocracy. \\nWe believe the best product should always win. And by “best” we \\nmean the product that objectively is of the highest quality and most \\neffective, not the one with the slickest TV advertisements.

This is how \\nusers end up feeling ignored and disempowered and how developers \\nend up completely disconnected. \\nA much better mode of interaction is to directly acknowledge users. \\nGive them a public bug tracker to complain in and respond to them \\ndirectly. Create an email list for them to help one another. If your \\nproduct can be open source, that’s a huge help as well.

The car is a black box—you just \\nwant to drive. For most people, the computer (and your software) \\nis a black box, too.

We’ve already talked about trust in the context \\nof HRT—about whether and how you exhibit trust toward your \\ncoworkers. In this case we’re talking about garnering trust from \\nusers. When a user trusts your team (or your company) it’s mainly \\nan emotional state: very few people would ever say, “I trust product \\nX because of this long list of facts that prove that my relationship \\nwith it carries zero risk.” They trust you because the cumulative set \\nof interactions they’ve had with you add up to an overall emotionally \\npositive state. \\nUSERS ARE PEOPLE, TOO 151 ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

How many of \\nthem have an auto mechanic they really trust? These days the answer \\nis nearly zero. Almost nobody trusts auto mechanics, because we’ve \\nbeen badgered by years of what is called “mailboxing”: when you \\ncome in for one scheduled service (like an oil change), but a bunch \\nof other unexpected maintenance services are piled on. Nobody \\nbelieves mechanics anymore, because they’ve been instructed to \\nmaximize profit at every opportunity. Remember, there is no such \\nthing as a temporary lapse of integrity. \\nThis is a great example of how the long-term relationship can be \\neasily sacrificed for short-term gain. Screw your customers just \\na teeny bit every now and then, and eventually they view the \\nrelationship through a veil of aggregated disdain. On the other \\nhand, every time your team does something helpful or useful, or is \\nresponsive, a bit of trust is added to an imaginary bank account in \\ntheir minds. When a baker adds a surprise 13th donut to your dozen \\n(“lagniappe,” as they call it in New Orleans), this brings a smile to \\nyour face. Over years of dealings the trust account grows and grows \\nuntil the mention of your product brings a warm, fuzzy feeling. \\nTrust can be dangerous, however, because it can be blown all at \\nonce—just like a bank account can be drained with a single stupid, \\nimpulsive, overpriced purchase. If your company does something \\nthat shows a total lack of respect for users (even if by accident), the \\ntrust bank is emptied overnight. \\nA good example of this (at the time of this writing, in late 2011) is \\nthe way Netflix temporarily messed up its relationship with users. \\nNetflix is a service for streaming movies over the Internet and also \\na way for renting DVDs by postal mail.

By early 2011 it had more than 23 million \\nsubscribers. \\nAt some point the business folks realized their DVD and streaming \\nservices were really separate businesses with separate profit models, \\nmanagement needs, and so on. So they decided to start charging \\nfor these businesses separately, raising their monthly fees 60% for \\nsome users. Customers were furious. Then Netflix announced that \\nit would be splitting into two separate companies for greater clarity \\nand convenience; to users this simply read as “now you have the \\nannoyance of two bills to pay instead of one.” Realizing they had a \\n152 CHAPTER 6 ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

It applies to your team: \\na culture based on humility, respect, and trust will spend the most \\ntime coding and the least time infighting. It applies to the way people \\nlead teams: skilled leaders serve their teams and not the other way \\naround. HRT also applies to the way you interoperate with and \\nsurvive temporary collaborators outside your team, whether they \\nare nice folks, jerks, or a dysfunctional bureaucracy.
